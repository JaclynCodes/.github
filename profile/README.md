*"Where sound meets science, harmony meets energy."*

I am a software engineer and researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of **audio processing** and **physics-based computations**. My work focuses on building tools that bridge the gap between acoustics and energy systems, making complex scientific data more accessible and actionable.

## 🚀 Featured Project: [Symphonic-Joules](https://github.com/JaclynCodes/Symphonic-Joules)

I am currently the lead developer of **Symphonic-Joules**, an open-source framework designed to calculate the energetic properties of sound and the sonic properties of physical systems.

- **Status:** v0.1.0 (Foundation Phase)
- **Focus:** 
  - 🎼 **Acoustic Energy:** Analyzing how sound waves carry and transform energy.
  - ⚡ **Physics-Informed Computing:** Implementing kinetic and potential energy transformations into audio signals.
  - 🔬 **Signal Processing:** Developing frequency-domain transformations for scientific insight.
